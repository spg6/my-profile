# Header 1

My name is Samuel and I am an Information Technology (IT) student at RMIT University. I was born in Australia and have lived mostly in Northern Victoria and Melbourne. Now I am currently based in Brisbane until January 2020, helping a university with an IT security project; which is providing to be both challenging and rewarding. In 2011 I graduated from high school and completed a Diploma of Information Technology at RMIT TAFE in 2016. My native language is English, and I know a little German and French. In January 2020 I am moving to southern France to begin on a new journey in IT and hope to establish a working knowledge of the French language in the next few years. Outside of IT, I read the news every single day. In fact, at the expense of my energy for the next day, I automatically wake up around 3 or 4 AM each morning to read the latest news reports across North America and Europe, before returning to sleep for a few hours.
