# Personal Profile (Personality Tests)

Myers–Briggs Type Indicator

The Myers-Briggs personality test indicates that I have the personality type of ‘The Protagonist’ (ENFJ-A) with the individual traits of Extraverted, 67%; Intuitive, 62%; Feeling, 74%; Judging, 76%; Assertive, 61%; alongside the role of diplomat, and strategy of people mastery.

The Visual, Aural, Read/Write, Kinesthetic (VARK) Questionnaire

The VARK result of ‘Multimodal’ suggests that I have a multi-mode method of learning; with the individual scores of Visual, 10; Aural, 7; Read/Write, 12; Kinesthetic, 11.

International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) Big Five Personality Test

IPIP’s Big Five Personality Test measures my personality traits of Factor 1 – Extroversion, 70%; Factor 2 – Emotional stability, 66%; Factor 3 – Agreeableness, 71%; Factor 4 – Conscientiousness, 62%; Factor 5 – Intellect/Imagination, 52%.

Reflection

The similar results presented in the IPIP Big File Personality and Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test show that I score highly for extraversion and agreeableness which indicate that I am outgoing, social and optimistic. Furthermore, Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test explains that I am assertive protagonist, and that I may believe myself to be too independent and not solicit the advice of others. The VARK test establishes that I have a ‘multimodal’ type of learning and shows that I am strongest in learning by reading and writing, in conjunction with the weakest learning mode of listening and speaking.  Overall, these results allow me to identify the strengths and weaknesses in my personality traits, as well as a learning style of various methods.

As a natural and enthusiastic communicator, I have a strong interest in working within an infrastructure team to implement cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, to improve business operations, and presenting findings and improvements to senior managers and leaders.

A disadvantage is that I can sometimes be impulsive and make on the spot decisions which have proven to result in negative consequences in a team. To resolve this, I will ensure that any decisions are made unanimously as a group and not immediately made effective to provide an option to reverse if a more appropriate decision is needed.

In the context of a team environment, these online tests provide a valuable insight of how I may behave unconsciously. As illustrated in the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and IPIP’s Big Five Personality test, I may perform strongly when communicating with other team members, however I may not be diligent in my actions, and instead make impulsive choices. In a learning perspective, VARK’s test shows that I may choose to engage with a team by reading or writing (such as email and instant messaging), visually with presentations and diagrams, but less in listening and talking in a spoken form such as in a conference or 1-on-1 meeting.

When forming a team, I should seek to identify the positives and negatives associated with my personality characteristics, including team members that I would work well with as an outgoing and social persons but also distinguishing current and prospective team members’ personality characteristics and traits that I score lower with, would be positive for the group. For example, as I may not be diligent in my actions and instead may make impulsive choices may mean that I could better serve as a communicator or presenter in a team, and someone else as a project manager.
