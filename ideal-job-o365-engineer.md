The above position is a specialist IT infrastructure role within the financial corporation Suncorp Group (Suncorp). In this position, it requires extensive knowledge and experience of Microsoft’s Office 365 ecosystem, Microsoft Azure, Mobile Device Management (MDM), IT Change Management and IT Security to maintain and support Microsoft’s suite of enterprise services within Suncorp.

The role of an IT Systems & Office 365 Engineer greatly interests me as I have a strong interest in Microsoft’s applications and services within an enterprise environment. In conjunction, I have a firm belief that the continuous improvement and implementation of IT systems is a key component of organisations achieving optimal efficiency.

Suncorp’s position of System Engineer, Office 365 requires a minimum of 5 years’ experience in the management of IT systems, with an emphasis on Microsoft’s Office 365 suite. This work experience is inclusive of the cloud version of Microsoft’s enterprise email service, Exchange Online; group-chat software, Microsoft Teams; cloud collaboration and document management system, SharePoint Online; and the cloud file storage system, OneDrive. Alongside of this technical expertise, it requires excellent communication skills, IT change management skills and experience working a medium to large company or institution.

To date, I have developed a strong skillset in administering and supporting Windows 10, PC Hardware and Apple Mac’s in an enterprise environment, among delivering IT training in Office 365 to corporate employees. In addition, I hold a vocational Diploma of Information Technology from RMIT University, with 3 years of Level 1 and 2 IT Support experience across Business Process Outsourcing, Higher Education and Marketing, and 7 years customer service experience in financial services and retail.

In order to become an IT Systems & Office 365 Engineer, I aim to focus further on three main realms: academia, industry certifications and gaining advanced IT support work experience, at a senior level. Upon completion of the Introduction to Information Technology and Introduction to Programming units, I intend to complete the Bachelor of Information Technology online through Open Universities Australia (OUA) and RMIT University.

Moreover, within the next 3 years I intend to complete two IT certifications. Initially, in the next 12 months, I plan to enrol for the Microsoft 365 Certified Teamwork Associate certification. This certification is the industry standard for validating the Office 365 <collaboration?> skillset. 

Secondly, I plan to complete the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) 4 Foundation certification which is the well-known and introductory standard for validating the IT Service Management (ITSM) skillset.

Combined with an undergraduate IT degree, industry certifications and professional experience at a senior IT support level, I will have developed a strong foundation to advance into an IT infrastructure position, and subsequently a specialised cloud-based system engineer role.
