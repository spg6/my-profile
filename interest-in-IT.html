**Interest in IT**

My main interest in IT is in Cloud Systems; specially, developing and implementing them, as well as supporting and maintaining them. Microsoft’s Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) are among my favourite, which I have a strong interest in implementing their continuous new features and developments.

My desire to learn more about IT started when my brother and I set up a home local area network (LAN) first by using a cross over cable, then purchasing a D-Link router to share our dial-up internet connection across 2 computers. A year later, I set up a home server with Debian Linux, along with a Samba file server and an Apache web server. Apart from my personal experience in IT, I have almost 3 years of work experience in IT, which has allowed me to develop strong troubleshooting skills across Mac, Windows 10, computer hardware and peripheral support.

As a previous IT student of RMIT TAFE, I developed an excellent foundation in a breadth across areas of IT from Windows Server, Java programming, Microsoft’s Database Management System (SQL Server) and Transact-SQL which is used in Microsoft SQL Server. From my experience at RMIT, I found the teaching to be both challenging and very supportive at the same time. Combined with my thirst for continuous learning, I am currently completing the Introduction to Information Technology and Introduction to Programming subjects at RMIT via online delivery, whilst working full-time as an IT Support Specialist.

In my studies, I aim to fulfil my internal hunger to learn and develop advanced level skills in Java programming, system administration and IT project management. Apart from IT, I aim to achieve a strong foundation in economics to complement my passion for current affairs and world news.
